Bucket Productive Activity vs. Wasteful Activity

Define productive metrics - coding vs. messaging vs. LinkedIn etc.



Questions to answer?
* When is my most effective time of day?
* When is my most distracted time of day?
* What activities can I move into marginal times?
* How often am I in deep focus?

Metrics for
* focus - was I staying on task?
* Productive - was I effective during my focused time?


Have GPT analyze each row and do "category" and "activity"
And then define when I'm distracted / not on task / switching between tasks
