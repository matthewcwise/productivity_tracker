Additional ideas:

Batch log processing
Dynamic website
Regular NLP function to adjust categorizations as necessary



Visualization:
Group by 10 minute segments

Bucket Productive Activity vs. Wasteful Activity

Define productive metrics - coding vs. messaging vs. LinkedIn etc.



Questions to answer?
* When is my most effective time of day?
* When is my most distracted time of day?
* What activities can I move into marginal times?
* How often am I in deep focus?

Metrics for
* focus - was I staying on task?
* Productive - was I effective during my focused time?


Have GPT analyze each row and do "category" and "activity"
And then define when I'm distracted / not on task / switching between tasks

Define sessions.

When I'm programming, what time of day is most productive?

There are times when I'm thinking, thinking about code


Group Sessions
 * need to see overall productivity of sessions
 * Overall focus of session


What about sessions and blocks?
* Blocks could show productivity (i.e. in this 10-minute window, how productive was I?)

Sessions are broken down into blocks.

From the time the session begins.

Do we see a tail? Productivity is high and then drops off?
